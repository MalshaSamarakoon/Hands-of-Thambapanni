<p>Cane crafts are found within certain areas in Sri Lanka, such as Bibile in Monaragala District, Polonnaruwa and Weweldeniya in the Gampaha District where cane is grown. Cane is used to make tables and chairs, baskets, containers and decorative and household items.

Cane stalks are bent and wound into different shapes while being heated, and it is known to last for up to 15 years or more. A favoured local product, cane woven products are found in almost every household.</p>
