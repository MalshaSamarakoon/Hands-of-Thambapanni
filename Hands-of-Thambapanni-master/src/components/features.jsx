                <p style={{color:'#318E6F'}}>Our story begins amidst a raging pandemic, when the entire world suddenly came to a stop. We deeply felt the need to reach out and help the tourism sector in Sri Lanka, which was in a piteous condition. It didn't take much longer for us to realize that there are others needing our help too. We, the team Hands of Thambapanni, are a bunch of dedicated and brilliant Rotaractors from the Rotaract Club of Uva Wellassa University - Badulla, striving to revamp the economic conditions of Small and Medium Scale Enterprises affiliated with the tourism industry. We're coupled with the passion to help SMEs and raw talent to drive this project towards success.</p>
